# SysDig CRD ideas
  - CRD to define monitors/alerts
  - CRD to define security rule / falco
  - deploy sysdig
    - helm chart
    - operator
    - deploy falco
  - CRD to create dashboard

# TODO
  - [ ] Research sysdig
  - [ ] Research Falco
  - [ ] Read blog posts
    - [ ] Istio stuff?
    - [ ] Prometheus
    - [ ] Custom monitor annotations/definitions
      - [ ] Operator/monitor
  - [ ] Document Sysdig value props & competitive advantages/SWOT?
  - [ ] Compare with grafana & datadog
  - [ ] priv sidecar on deployment with annotation instead of daemon set
  - [ ] what are falco's value prop and competitive advantages?
  - [ ] Where is falco going?
  - [ ] where could it go?
  - [ ] turn this all into a checklist
  - [ ] Falco -f rules.yaml -f rules2.yaml -> kubectl create -f falco-rules-crd.yaml
  - [ ] Falco helm chart
  - [ ] Falco operator might be better for this than a crd, no CRD is better
  - [ ] Pros/Cons of CRD vs operator
  - [ ] Figure out how to reload falco or have falco sigup/load new rulesets
  - [ ] https://github.com/draios/falco/blob/dev/examples/k8s-using-daemonset/k8s-without-rbac/falco-daemonset.yaml
  - [ ] Create helm chart (determine if rbac or not) for deploying falco
  - [ ] look into ksonnet for helm chart generation
  - [ ] config maps for multiple falco rules files
  - [ ] https://sysdig.com/blog/runtime-security-kubernetes-sysdig-falco/
  - [ ] Get falco chart into kubernetes charts repo
  - [ ] Build falco -> alert manager integration
    - [ ] Build falco prometheus metrics endpoint
    - [ ] Build falco prometheus collector/alertmanager alerts
